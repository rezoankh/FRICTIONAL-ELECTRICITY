      FRICTIONAL ELECTRICITY

      From "The Saturday Evening Post." <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I happened to visit the accident ward of St. Paracelsus' Hospital because
      a friend of mine who is interested in the Flower Mission asked me to stop
      there during my afternoon walk and give a few flowers to the sufferers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had arranged the last half-dozen of the roses in a vase upon the
      little stand by the bedside of one bruised and battered patient, he looked
      at me gratefully, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thank you, sir! And would you mind, sir, stopping for a bit of talk?
      I'm so lonely and miserable."
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat upon the chair by the bed and with my hand smoothed the counterpane,
      while the patient asked me:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I really look like a burglar, sir, do you think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I hesitated to reply as I examined his face. It was really covered with
      bandages, but his nose seemed swollen and there were bruises about both
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't wonder you don't like to speak your mind when you see me here a
      broken wreck, smashed all up and not looking a bit like myself, sir. But
      if you would see me well and strong and all fixed up for going to church
      you'd say right off that I don't favor no burglar in looks."
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked the unfortunate man his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mordecai Barnes, sir, and I'm a journeyman plumber, sir, with a good
      character, and don't take no second place in that business with no man.
      How did I get here? What banged me all up into a shame and a disgrace like
      this? Well, I'll tell you, sir, if you have the patience to listen, for it
      does me good to talk who has been used so hard, and can get no attention
      from the nurses or nobody in this here asylum. Do you understand about
      frictional electricity, sir? No? I thought not; and well had it been for
      me, for this shattered hulk that you see a-lying here, if I had never
      heard of it neither! I'll tell you how it was, sir. My mate, George
      Watkins, and there ain't no better man nowheres if you go clear round the
      globe&mdash;George Watkins is one of these men with inquiring minds,
      always a-hungering for knowledge, and so George off he goes week after
      week to the lectures up at the Huxley Institute. You know it; in that
      yallow building over by Nonpareil Square. And George often he told me
      about the wonderful things he learned there, and among others he was fond
      of explaining to me about frictional electricity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems, sir, for you may not know it any" more'n I knowed it until
      George explained it to me, that there's three different kinds of
      electricity. There's the kind you make with a steam engine, and the kind
      you make with acid, and the kind you make with friction. Well, sir, would
      you believe&mdash;or, let me say first, have you ever rubbed a black cat
      on the back in a dark room and seen the sparks fly? Of course, and, sir, I
      know it's almost beyond belief, but, positive, they told George Watkins,
      my mate, up at the Huxley Institute, that them sparks and the aurora
      borealis that you see sometimes a-lighting up the heavens is one and the
      same thing! Wonderful, isn't it, sir, that Science should discover that a
      black cat is some kind of kin to the aurora borealis? But George says
      that's what they said, for the aurora borealis is caused by the earth
      a-rolling around and rubbing the air just as the sparks is caused by
      stroking the cat's back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And George he says that this here frictional electricity is the only kind
      that'll cure pain. The steam-engine kind won't do it, and the acid kind
      won't do it, but the frictional kind'll do it every time if you only know
      how to apply it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir, now I pass to the sorrerful part of my story. There is a girl
      named Bella Dougherty that does housework for a man named Muffitt, and a
      mighty nice girl she is; or, I used to think her nice. Maybe you know
      where Mr. Muffitt lives, on 149th Street, just above Parvin Street, the
      third house on the left with white shutters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyhow, I got to be fond of Bella and often used to set and talk with her
      in the evenings in Mr. Muffitt's kitchen, and maybe have two or three
      other girls come in sometimes, with a few men; though I never cared, sir,
      for much flocking together at such times, for Bella Dougherty she was good
      enough company for me, just her and I by ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Howsomdever, there was another man that had a kind of fancy for Bella
      Dougherty, although in my opinion he isn't fit to wipe her feet on, and
      his name is William Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This yer William Jones used to come intruding around there in Mr.
      Muffitt's kitchen when he wasn't wanted and when he seen that me and Bella
      would rather be a-setting there by ourselves. And so, sir, one night, just
      to kill the time till he'd quit and go, I begun to tell them what George
      Watkins said to me about the Huxley Institute and frictional electricity
      being a sure cure for pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And William Jones, a-winking at Bella Dougherty, as much as to say, sir,
      that he'd be having the laugh on me, said he had a pain that minute in his
      head from neuralgia and he'd bet me a quarter no frictional electricity
      would drive it out. I know now what was the matter with the head of
      William Jones. Not neuralgia, nor nothing of the sort, sir. It was vacuum.
      My mate, George Watkins, tells me that at the Institute they say that
      vacuum always produces pain, and that was the only thing the matter with
      this William Jones I'm a-telling you about.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never take no dare, not from no man of that kind, anyways, sir, so I
      bet him a quarter I'd cure him, and cure him with frictional electricity,
      too. So he set down on the chair a-laughing and a-winking at Bella
      Dougherty, who set over by the range holding the quarters; and I begun to
      rub William Jones's eye-brows with my two thumbs; just gently, but right
      along just like stroking a cat; keeping it up, a-rubbing and a-rubbing,
      until at last I asked him how he felt now; and, you can imagine my
      supprise, sir, when I seen that William Jones was fast asleep! I was
      skeered at first; but in a minute I seen that I had hypnertized him
      unbeknown to myself, and there set William Jones 's if he was froze stiff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wa'n't so very sorry, sir, when I found out how things was a-going,
      although if I could have seen what was the consequences of this strange
      occurrence I'd 'a' seized my hat and bid Bella Dougherty good-by and
      started straight for home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, sir, of course I acted like a fool, for I'd read in the papers how a
      man who hypnertizes another man can make him believe anything and do
      anything, and so I thought I'd have some fun with William Jones and enjoy
      a lovely, quiet evening with Bella Dougherty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I says to William Jones:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Now, William, you're a little school-scholar oncet again and you've
      missed your lesson, and so you just go over there in that corner by the
      china closet and stand with your face to the wall and say over and over
      your multiplication table till you know it right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so, to the supprise of Bella Dougherty, William Jones went right over
      in the corner, like I told him, and there he stood, saying: 'Six sixes is
      thirty-six, six sevens is forty-two,' and so on, whilst I set over with
      Bella Dougherty peacefully enjoying ourselves just exactly 's if William
      Jones wasn't anywheres about.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so, sir, it went on until Mrs. Muffitt she come down and said to
      Bella Dougherty it was time to shut the house up, and then I bid her
      good-night and told William to go home and go straight to bed, which he
      did, and a-saying the multiplication table all the way down the street. He
      would have said it all night, sir, I do believe, if I hadn't ordered him
      to stop and to begin saying his prayers when I passed him in at his front
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may believe me, sir, that I had William Jones on my mind all night
      and was a-worrying a little about him too, for fear maybe he'd never come
      to. So around I goes the first thing in the morning to his boarding-house,
      and his landlady tells me he had been a-saying his prayers all mixed up
      like with the multiplication table ever since he come home the night
      before. She was a bit troubled about it, sir, as you may imagine, for
      William Jones was a good boarder and it 'd 'a' been money out of her
      pocket if he had lost his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, then, I seen William Jones and knowed at oncet that the hypnertizing
      still had hold of him. Very well; I had no idea how to get him out of it
      and it didn't hurt him nohow, so I just commanded William Jones to drop
      the multiplication table and his prayers and to fix all his intellect in
      the regular way on plumbing; and William Jones at oncet calmed down and
      seemed his old self again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then a wicked thought flashed into my mind. You know how it is yourself,
      sir; you are tempted and you are weak and you fall, and then the first
      thing you know, to be sure your sin'll find you out and there you are!
      Here I am, a shattered hulk. It suddenly occurred to me, sir, that if I
      could control William Jones, why not turn his affections away from Bella
      Dougherty, who might take a fancy to him? who knows? women are so queer!
      and direct his thoughts toward my own Aunt Maggie, who is a middle-aged
      widder and not so bad-looking, and far too good for such a man as William
      Jones, although to speak the plain truth I had no objections to having him
      for an uncle by marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Therefore I did so, sir, and before the week was out I heard that William
      Jones was plumbing in the most supprising manner, plumbing here and
      plumbing there, and paying attentions vigorously, so to speak, to Aunt
      Maggie every evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the meantime, sir, believe me, I did not lose time in my suit with
      Bella Dougherty, who seemed real mad at William Jones when people began to
      talk about his courting Aunt Maggie, so that in less than two weeks, when
      Bella Dougherty heard that William Jones and Aunt Maggie had agreed to
      marry, I got Bella Dougherty about as good as to say, although she never
      quite said it square, that she would have me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never knowed how it happened, sir, whether somebody waked William Jones
      up or he just come to by himself, but, sir, anyhow, William Jones about
      that time dropped hypner-tism and was himself again. Imagine, sir, how
      things stood! There never was a man as mad as William Jones; mad with me,
      and mad with Aunt Maggie, to whom he sent a cruel message that he wa'n't
      marrying no grandmas, and that made Aunt Maggie mad; and then William
      Jones sat down and wrote me a letter to the general effect that whenever
      he met me my course in this life would be short.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naturally, sir, as you may believe, I kept out of William Jones's way,
      for I am not fond of quarreling, and besides, William Jones is forty
      pounds heavier, sir, than I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But one night while I was setting in the kitchen at Muffitt's, having
      some uplifting conversation with Bella Dougherty, there was a sudden knock
      on the side door, and up she jumps, pale and skeered, and says: 'I do
      believe that is William Jones. He said he might call, maybe, this
      evening!' So, of course, as I never hunt trouble, I raised the window sash
      over by the kitchen table at the back and went out just as William Jones
      come in the side door. He kept the door open a-watching for me, and so as
      I couldn't get to the gate I climbed over the high fence into the next
      yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to have gone right home, sir, without stopping, but I hated to
      leave William Jones there with Bella Dougherty, and me just driven out;
      so, as it was raining hard and I had on my Sunday suit, what does I do but
      try the latch on the kitchen door of the house next to Mr. Muffitt's, and
      finding the door opened, in I walked and set down in a chair to await what
      was going to happen. That was a bad job for me, sir! It isn't safe to take
      one false step.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the next minute the inside door from the dining-room springs open and
      a man jumps out and grabs me and says: 'I've got thee at last, have I!' He
      was a Quaker, sir; a big man and with a grip like iron. I never knowed a
      man with a grip like that. Did you ever, sir, have your fingers in the
      crack of a door and somebody a-leaning hard on the door? That was the way
      this Quaker held me. Then he calls out 'Amelia! Amelia!' and in a minute a
      sweet old Quaker lady comes out with a candle, and he says to her: I've
      caught that burglar, Amelia; thee get the clothes line.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So the lady she gets the clothes line and that man he ties my hands and
      my arms behind my back, good and tight, and then he made me set down and
      he ties me to the chair, and at last he gives the rope two or three turns
      around the leg of the kitchen table and says to me: 'Friend, thee can just
      set there while I go to get an officer!' Gave me no chance to explain.
      Took it all for granted; whereas if he would have listened to me I could
      have cleared up the whole mystery in two minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So then, sir, out he goes for a policeman, and the old lady sets down in
      a chair not far from me and said she was sorry I was so wicked and asked
      me about my mother, and if I ever went to First-Day school, and a whole
      lot of things. Then a thought seemed to strike her and she went into the
      next room and came back with a book in her hand, and she said she would
      read a good book to me while we waited for justice to take its course.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was lovely to look at, sir, with her tidy brown frock and the crape
      handkerchief folded acrost her bosom and her cap and the smile on her
      face; a sweet face, sir; an angel face; yes, sir, but sweet faces often
      has cruel dispositions behind them. For then she told me that the book was
      called Barclay's Apology for the People called Quakers, or something like
      that, and she begun to read it to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever read that book, sir? It is dedicated, I think, to Charles
      the Second, and it begins with Fifteen Propositions, and she read every
      one of them Propositions from first to last. Then she turned to the
      section, sir, about Salutations and Recreations, and she read and read and
      read until, sir, actually it made my head swim.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know, sir, is Barclay still alive&mdash;the man who wrote that
      book? Is there no way of getting even with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't get away. I might have walked out somehow with the chair
      fastened to me; but I couldn't go, could I, sir, with the table tied to my
      leg, and particularly if I had to climb the fence? So I had to set there
      and be regarded as a burglar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But at last I <i>would</i> be heard, and I told her I was no burglar but
      an innercent man; and then she looked in the index to find if Barclay had
      anything interesting to say about the wickedness of telling falsehoods.
      And then I said I was a member of the Baptist Society, and she said at
      once she would read Barclay on the errors of that sect; but I insisted on
      being heard, and I explained to her that I got into this trouble by trying
      to cure William Jones by frictional electricity, and she said: 'Thee has
      an ingenious and fruitful mind to invent such a story. Oh, that it had
      been turned to better devices than following a life of evil!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'And it seems hard, too,' I said, 'that a perfectly respectable Baptist
      plumber should be arrested as a burglar simply because he tried to relieve
      the pain of William Jones by a scientific method invented by the Huxley
      Institute.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is thy friend William Jones?' she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know, sir, at that very moment you could hear through the
      partition William Jones and Bella Dougherty laughing next door! It seemed
      like mockery to me, a-setting there in chains, so to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'He is next door, ma'am,' I said, 'a-courting the hired girl.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I will prove if thee is telling the truth,' she said, and she got up and
      moved toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No, ma'am, no!' I said; 'please don't do that! William mustn't know that
      I am here'; and so she comes back and sets down again, and picks up
      Barclay, and looks sorrerful at me, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It is wicked for thee to have such vain imaginations. Why does thee
      persist in pretending that there is a William Jones?' And then she started
      to look through Barclay to find if he had anything that would fit the
      William Jones part of the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What could I do? I daresn't call in William Jones to prove my innercence;
      he was mad all over at me and a bigger man, too, and here I was tied; and
      I couldn't call Bella Dougherty without William Jones knowing it. It was
      hard, sir, for a man as innercent as a little babe to set there with that
      sweet and smooth old lady considering him a shameless story-teller and
      firing Barclay at him, now wasn't it, sir? Would you have called William
      Jones, sir, under them there circumstances, and his laughter and Bella
      Dougherty's still a-resounding through the partition?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir, that policeman was a long time a-coming with the old Quaker. I
      never knowed why; but Friend Amelia she set down again and turned over the
      leaves of Barclay and begun oncet more to read about Salutations and
      Recreations while, strange as it may seem to you, sir, I felt that I'd
      rather see the policeman and be locked up in a dungeon than to hear more
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, howsomdever, after a while in comes the Quaker and the officer with
      him, and the very first minute the officer seen me he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I reckernize him as an old offender.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No you don't!' says I; 'I'm no old offender nor a young offender. I'm a
      perfeckly honest Baptist plumber, and I kin prove it, too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'How kin you prove it?' says the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'By William Jones,' says I, 'who is a-setting in that kitchen right next
      door, a-wooing the hired girl.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was bold about it, sir, because I knowed William Jones daresn't strike
      at me while the officer was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'We'll see about that,' says the officer, and in he goes to Mr. Muffitt's
      yard next door and comes back with William Jones. I have no use for a man
      like William Jones. What do you think he does, sir? Why, he looks me over,
      from head to foot, in a blank sort of a way, and then, turning to the
      policeman, he says: 'I don't know the man, officer; never seen him
      before'; then that low-down plumber walks out and leaves me there and goes
      back, and in a minute I hear him and Bella Dougherty a-laughing worse than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I thought not,' says the officer, slipping the handcuffs on me, 'and so
      now you come right along.' And Friend Amelia looked mournful at me and
      says to me she would come around regular and read Barclay to me in my cell
      after I was convicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so, sir, to make a long story short, I was took up before the
      magistrate and held for burglary, and my mate, George Watkins, went my
      bail and so I was let go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might stop here, sir, but I must tell you that the following Thursday I
      met William Jones up a kind of a blind alley where I was working, while he
      was working in a house on the opposite side. He had me in a corner where
      there was no chance to run, so I put on a bold face and went right up to
      him and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'William, there's been some differences betwixt us, but I'm not the man
      to bear grudges and I forgive you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What's that?' says he, savage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Why,' says I, 'the whole thing is just one of them unpleasant
      misunderstandings'; and then I started to explain to him about the Huxley
      Institute theory of frictional electricity and the aurora borealis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't tell what he said, sir, in reply, with reference to the aurora
      borealis, because I'm a decent man and never use no low language; but
      suddenly he jumped on me, and the first thing I knowed I was being lifted
      in the ambulance and fetched to this yer hospital. Was it right, sir, do
      you think, for William Jones to strike me foul, like that, while I was
      trying to state my case to him? No, sir. But that's not the worst of it.
      Last Tuesday word came to me that Bella Dougherty had throwed me over and
      is going to marry William Jones on Decoration Day! Think of that, sir!"
      and Mordecai Barnes turned his head upon his pillow and moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning again toward me, he was about to resume his statement, when
      suddenly he exclaimed: "Why, there's Aunt Maggie."
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman of fifty years, nicely clad, came to the bedside and said to him
      coldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that you, Mordecai Barnes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Aunt Maggie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm ashamed of you, Mordecai Barnes," said she; "ashamed of you. It
      served you right. You got just what was comin' to you. I wish William had
      banged you worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai Barnes groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And more than that," continued Aunt Maggie, glaring at him through her
      spectacles, "I've torn up my old will which named you my sole heir and
      made a new one and left all my property to this yer very hospital."
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words Aunt Maggie walked away and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai Barnes could not speak for a few minutes. He looked as if death
      would be welcome. Then, pulling the bedclothes up under his chin and
      closing his eyes wearily, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Curse the day, say I, when George Watkins first went to the Huxley
      Institute and heard about frictional electricity."
